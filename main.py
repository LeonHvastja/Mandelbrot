Project goal: make a script that generates mandelbrot set images

Goals:
1.Make code that uses the math to generate a single point value
...
2.Generate a set of complex numbers to run through the calculations
The mandelbrot set occurs roughly from x = [-2,0.5] and y = [-1, 1] so it
would make sense to bound the values to roughly that range.

My monitors each have a 16:9 aspect ratio and 2560x1440 pixels.
